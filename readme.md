# Project Description

Manic is a reworking/improvement of a previous unreleased project called Manga-Nest built using the Laravel framework.

Manic is an open source website for hosting and sharing manga.  It was inspired by seeing various sites with a similar concept around the internet.  As I was unable to find a site which provided it's source code so that I could run it on my own machine I decided to build my own.
